This is the code and data associated to the article:
Crouzet, Overgaard & Busch (201X) The fastest saccadic responses escape visual masking. PLoS ONE.

Figure2_compute_merged.m and Figure2_compute_perobs.m should be run first to perform the boostrap analysis (it takes some time) and create the result files res_Rall_boot.mat and res_R_boot.mat

Then, Figure2_plot.m will allow to reproduce the Figure 2 of the paper.

Figures_SuppInfo.m allows to reproduce the two Supplementary Info figures.

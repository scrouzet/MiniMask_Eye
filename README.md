# Code
`Figure2_compute_merged.m` and `Figure2_compute_perobs.m` should be run first to perform the boostrap analysis (it takes some time) and create the result files `res_Rall_boot.mat` and `res_R_boot.mat`

Then, `Figure2_plot.m` will allow to reproduce the Figure 2 of the paper.

`Figures_SuppInfo.m` allows to reproduce the two Supplementary Info figures.

# Data
`datasetS1.csv` is stricly equivalent to `data.mat` and is here to share the data also in a non-proprietary format.
